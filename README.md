# The Legend of Zeldaâ„¢: Breath of the Wild & Tears of the Kingdom unofficial item upgrade tracker.

This project (built upon Create-React-App) allows users to easily track item goals in these two Legend of Zelda games. Primarily intended for keeping track of outstanding requirements to upgrade clothing items, the application is flexible enough to track any goal you have for which item collection is necessary.

Simply open the app (instructions below), set your goals, and then every time you collect a relevant item (or whenever you feel like updating the list), enter the collected item.

## How to run:
To run the application in development mode (good enough for most uses), you must first have [node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org) installed. Once you've done that, open a terminal pointed at the project's root folder, then:
1. Install dependencies. `npm install`.
2. Run the server. `npm start`.
3. Open the site on your preferred device. (Note, progress does not sync between devices).

## Building:
You can build this application into pure front-end files, which you can then use with any server. Simply run the build script (`npm run build`), and you'll find the files in a `build` folder. From there, host them however you'd like.
